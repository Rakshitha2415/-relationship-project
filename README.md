# 💖 Relationship Project
Predict relationship  using survey responses with the help of machine learning.
This project combines **unsupervised** clustering to generate labels and a **supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to perform the final classification.

**📌 Project Overview**

The **Relationship Project** analyzes answers from a relationship-based questionnaire to predict whether two individuals would make a good match.

**🔗 Pipeline Includes:**
* 📊 Survey Data Collection via Google Forms
* 🏷️ Label Generation using **KMeans Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning)
* 🧠 Model Training using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** (Supervised Learning)
This hybrid approach allows the model to:

* Discover natural clusters in respondent preferences (unsupervised),
* Learn complex patterns for accurate classification (supervised).
The final model is deployed through a **Streamlit app**, allowing users to input their answers and receive real-time compatibility predictions.

**📊 1. Data Collection**
* Responses gathered via a Google Form with **12 questions.**
* Questions were designed to capture preferences and personality traits.
* **149 responses** were collected and stored in CSV format.
  
**🏷️ 2. Data Labeling**
* Applied **KMeans Clustering** with k=2 to classify responses as either:
* ✅ "Match"
* ❌ "No Match"
* Used clustering to avoid rule-based bias and reveal natural groupings.
  
**🔠 3. Preprocessing**
* Applied **Label Encoding** to transform categorical answers into numerical format.
* Chosen for its compactness and order preservation.
  
**🧠 4. Model Architecture**
Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN):

* 2 Hidden Layers with **ReLU**
* **Dropout + Batch Normalization** for regularization
* **Sigmoid Output Layer** for binary classification
  
**💾 5. Model Saving**
* Trained model saved as: best_model.keras using **Keras**
* **ModelCheckpoint** used to retain the best performing weights
  
**🧪 6. Inference with Streamlit**
The app (app.py) is built using **Streamlit:**

* Accepts user inputs through a form
* Uses the trained model to predict compatibility
* Displays results in real-time
